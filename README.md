In this project, I modified the HTML and CSS files to add accessibility and efficiency.

### HTML: 
    I added semantic HTML tags, such as <section>, <article>, <aside>, <header>, and <footer>, replacing generic
    tags, such as <div>. This will help with Search Engine Optimization, as well as meet accessibility standards. 

### CSS:
    I consolidated several CSS classes and ID's that used the same specifications by renaming them in the HTML and removing
    any repeated elements. I also reordered elements to match the flow and structure of the HTML.

### Overall:
    I added whitespace and comments to both files to aid in readability.
